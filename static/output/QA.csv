Question,Answer
"1. What is the definition of diarrhea, and how many times a day does it occur?","According to the text, diarrhea is defined as a change in consistency and frequency of stools, i.e., liquid or watery stools, that occur more than 3 times a day."
2. What percentage of acute diarrhea episodes subside within 7 days?,"According to the text, in the vast majority of cases, acute episodes of diarrhea subside within 7 days. This is not a specific percentage, but it implies that most cases (likely more than 80-90%) resolve on their own within a week."
"3. What is the global annual burden of diarrhea, and what percentage of childhood deaths does it account for?","According to the text, the global annual burden of diarrhea is 1.7 billion cases, and it accounts for approximately 11% of all childhood deaths worldwide."
"4. What is the leading cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis worldwide?","The leading cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis worldwide is Rotavirus."
5. What are the two most common causes of diarrheal episodes among children in India?,"According to the text, the two most common causes of diarrheal episodes among children in India are:

1. Rotavirus
2. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)

These two causes account for nearly half of the diarrheal episodes among children in India."
6. What percentage of childhood diarrhea is caused by enterotoxin-producing E. coli (ETEC)?,"According to the text, enterotoxin-producing E. coli (ETEC) accounts for nearly 20% of childhood diarrhea."
"7. What are the other causes of acute diarrhea, apart from bacterial and viral infections?","According to the provided context, the other causes of acute diarrhea, apart from bacterial and viral infections, are:

1. Intestinal infections
2. Drugs
3. Food allergies
4. Systemic infections
5. Surgical conditions

These causes are mentioned under the ""Other causes"" section of the context."
"8. What are the two compartments of body water, and what percentage of body weight is water?","According to the text, the two compartments of body water are:

1. Extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment
2. Intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment

And, approximately 60% of a child's body weight is water, which is distributed between these two compartments."
"9. What happens to sodium levels in plasma in 50% of cases of diarrhea, and what is the resulting effect on the body?","In 50% of cases of diarrhea, the concentration of sodium in plasma remains normal (140mEq/L). However, in the other 45-50% of cases, excessive sodium is lost in stools, leading to a relative decline in serum sodium (hyponatremia) and a fall in ECF osmolality. This causes water to move from the intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment to the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment, resulting in further shrinkage of the already reduced extracellular compartment volume in hyponatremic dehydration."
"10. What are the clinical features of hyponatremic dehydration, and how do they differ from those of hypernatremic dehydration?","According to the provided context, the clinical features of hyponatremic dehydration are:

* Skin appears soggy, doughy, or leathery (masks loss of skin turgor due to increased osmolality of ECF)
* Weak, thready pulse
* Low blood pressure
* Cold extremities

In contrast, hypernatremic dehydration is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, in general, the clinical features of hypernatremic dehydration are:

* Dry, wrinkled skin with decreased skin turgor
* Sunken eyes
* Decreased tears
* Dry mouth and tongue
* Thirst
* Restlessness and irritability
* High blood pressure
* Rapid pulse

The key differences between hyponatremic and hypernatremic dehydration are:

* Skin appearance: Hyponatremic dehydration presents with soggy, doughy, or leathery skin, while hypernatremic dehydration presents with dry, wrinkled skin.
* Blood pressure: Hyponatremic dehydration is associated with low blood pressure, while hypernatremic dehydration is associated with high blood pressure.
* Osmolality: Hyponatremic dehydration is characterized by a decrease in serum sodium levels and a decrease in ECF osmolality, while hypernatremic dehydration is characterized by an increase in serum sodium levels and an increase in ECF osmolality."
11. What are the goals of assessment in a child with acute diarrhea?,"The goals of assessment in a child with acute diarrhea are:

1. Determine the type of diarrhea
2. Look for dehydration
3. Assess for malnutrition"
12. What are the key aspects of history-taking in a child with acute diarrhea?,"According to the provided context, the key aspects of history-taking in a child with acute diarrhea are:

1. Onset of diarrhea
2. Blood in stools
3. Number of episodes of vomiting
4. Presence of fever, cough
5. Type and amount of food taken during illness
6. Drugs
7. Immunization history"
"13. What are the physical examination findings in a child with no dehydration, some dehydration, and severe dehydration?","According to the provided context, the physical examination findings in a child with no dehydration, some dehydration, and severe dehydration are as follows:

**No Dehydration:**

* Condition: Well alert
* Eyes: Normal
* Tears: Present
* Mouth and Tongue: Moist
* Thirst: Drinks normally
* Skin pinch: Goes back quickly
* Feel: Normal

**Some Dehydration:**

* Condition: Restless, irritable
* Eyes: Sunken
* Tears: Absent
* Mouth and Tongue: Dry
* Thirst: Thirsty, drinks eagerly
* Skin pinch: Goes back slowly
* Feel: Dry

**Severe Dehydration:**

* Condition: Lethargic, floppy, unconscious
* Eyes: Very sunken
* Tears: Absent
* Mouth and Tongue: Very dry
* Thirst: Drinks poorly
* Skin pinch: Goes back very slowly
* Feel: Very dry"
14. What are the laboratory investigations typically included in the diagnosis of acute diarrhea?,"According to the provided context, the laboratory investigations typically included in the diagnosis of acute diarrhea are:

1. Stool analysis to identify the causative organism, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites.
2. Electrolyte levels, including:
	* Sodium levels (normal range: 135-145 mEq/L)
	* Potassium levels (normal range: 3.5-5.5 mEq/L)
3. Hemogram, including:
	* Hemoglobin (Hb)
	* Total Leukocyte Count (TLC)
	* Differential Leukocyte Count (DLC)
4. Stool pH, which can be estimated using nitrazine paper (normal range: 7.0-8.0)
5. Bicarbonate levels (normal range: 18-22 mEq/L)

These tests are performed only if the child has pallor, labored breathing, altered sensorium, seizures, or oliguria."
15. What are the normal serum sodium and potassium levels in pediatric patients?,"According to the text, the normal serum sodium levels in pediatric patients are:

* 135-145 mEq/L

And the normal serum potassium levels in pediatric patients are:

* 3.5-5.5 mEq/L"
"16. What is the significance of stool pH, and how is it estimated?","The significance of stool pH is that it can help identify the type of diarrhea. A stool pH of less than 5.5 suggests a non-infectious cause of diarrhea, such as lactose intolerance or carbohydrate malabsorption, whereas a stool pH of greater than 5.5 suggests an infectious cause of diarrhea.

Stool pH can be estimated using nitrazine paper. Here's how:

1. Dip the pH paper into the stool sample, making sure to wet the paper evenly.
2. Compare the resulting color to the reference chart provided with the pH paper to determine the pH value.

Normal stool pH is between 7.0 and 8.0."
